*1.025.dev.prerelease*

- More bug fixes

*1.025.dev*

- A search bar (Partially done. Has some issues)

- UI bug fixes (All known bugs fixed!)
- More miscellaneous bug fixes (All known bugs fixed!)

*1.025*

- Fixed the search bar(FINALLY. Took a long time. Turns out it was a very simple solution)
